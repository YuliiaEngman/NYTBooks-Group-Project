### Description:
  This project will query the NYTimes API in order to get data, and populate it in their perspective controllers.

Inside of the first controller the top 10 bestselling books from any given category are displayed inside of a collection view. There is also a picker view that allows for you to select from the available categories inside of that same tab.

The very next controller is the favorites controller which has a collection view that will only populate based on what was saved.
